# BioSNAP Applications

BioSNAP is a compilation of biomedical datasets in graph form that represent the relationships between various biomedical entities. In this repository are some sample scripts that demonstrate the functionality of DeepSNAP using some of the BioSNAP datasets.

For now, datasets for these examples can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/farzaan/deepsnap-bio-application-datasets
